## Introduction: The Next Evolution in E-Commerce Product Photography

Building on our revolutionary single-model clothing try-on technology, we're excited to introduce **Batch Model Clothing Try-On**—a game-changing solution designed specifically for fashion e-commerce and cross-border e-commerce businesses. This powerful feature transforms how you create product images, enabling you to process multiple clothing items simultaneously with unprecedented efficiency.

## What is Batch Model Clothing Try-On?

Batch Model Clothing Try-On extends our proven single-model virtual try-on technology to handle multiple clothing items in a single workflow. Instead of processing one item at a time, you can now upload up to **50 clothing items** simultaneously, dramatically reducing the time and effort required to create professional product images for your e-commerce store.

## Key Features for E-Commerce Businesses

### Bulk Upload Capability

**Upload Up to 50 Items at Once**

- Drag and drop multiple clothing images simultaneously
- Support for batch upload of tops, bottoms, or full outfits
- Streamlined workflow that saves hours of manual work
- Perfect for processing entire product catalogs efficiently

### Asynchronous Background Processing

**Tasks Continue Even After You Close the Page**

One of the most powerful features for busy e-commerce teams is our asynchronous task processing system:

- **Background Execution**: All tasks run in the background, independent of your browser session
- **No Interruption**: Close your browser, switch devices, or continue working—your tasks keep running
- **Automatic Updates**: Completed results automatically appear in your history, ready for review
- **Reliable Processing**: Tasks are queued and processed sequentially to ensure quality and prevent system overload

This means you can start a batch of 50 clothing try-on tasks, close your computer, and return later to find all results completed and ready for download.

### Batch Download Functionality

**Download All Results in One Click**

- Download all completed try-on images as a single ZIP file
- Organized file naming for easy identification
- Save time by downloading multiple results simultaneously
- Perfect for bulk importing into your e-commerce platform

### Complete History Integration

## Perfect for Fashion E-Commerce Businesses
